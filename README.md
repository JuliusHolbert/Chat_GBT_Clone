**About:**

This project is a simple web-based ChatGBT clone that I built

**How To Run**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and then open the folder in your code editor of choice
2. run "npm install" to install the packages required to run the software.
3. Get an OpenAI API key from their website. The key will not work unless you set up a paid account. Put the key in the .env folder
4. in the terminal, run "npm run start:frontend" and open another terminal and run "npm run start:backend"

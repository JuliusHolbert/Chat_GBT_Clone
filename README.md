**About:**

This project is a simple web-based ChatGPT clone that I built. It was originally built using OpenAI’s API, but after the removal of the free-tier model, I switched to Groq, which I currently recommend due to its generous free-tier limits.

**How To Run**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and open the folder in your code editor of choice
2. In your terminal, change directory into both the frontend folder (cd frontend) and the backend folder (cd backend), and run npm install in each to download their dependencies.
3. Get a Groq API key from "https://console.groq.com/keys". Feel free to use another AI Model of your choice as well. Place the key in the .env file located in the backend directory.
4. in a terminal, cd into the frontend folder, and the backend folder, and run the command "npm start" for both directories.
